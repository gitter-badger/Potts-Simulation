\subsection*{Running the stable code}

To compile the code in terminal use {\itshape make} or instead to compile and run, write {\itshape make run}. Do not break the directory tree to keep makefiles and scripts fully working.

\subsection*{Folder structure}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape bench} \+: Keeps some useful benchmarks, more info in the readme inside the folder.
\item {\itshape build} \+: Default directory where the binaries are going to be generated
\item {\itshape include} \+: Default directory that keeps the \char`\"{}frontend\char`\"{} includes
\item {\itshape src} \+: Default directory that keeps the source files.
\item {\itshape lib} \+: Default directory that keeps all the .cpp and .h used in a generic source file.
\item {\itshape tests} \+: Directory in which is possible to run some regression tests
