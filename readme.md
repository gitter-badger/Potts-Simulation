# Potts simulation model

There are three branches of the code:
  * *original_version* : Keeps the original version of the code
  * *restyling* : it's updated every time new code is written (is the development branch)
  * *master* : it keeps the stable release of the code (in the sense that the code has been checked and gives realistic results)

## Running the stable code

To download the code clone or fork the project and type on a terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/leonardoromor/Potts-Simulation.git

To compile the code in terminal use *make* or instead to compile and run, write *make run*.

### How to sync with the repository

  A simple git pull inside the cloned folder should to the job. In case of troubles contact me.
